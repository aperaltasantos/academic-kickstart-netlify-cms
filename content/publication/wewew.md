abstract: Emergency department (ED) triage systems aim to direct the best clinical assistance to those who are in the greatest urgency and guarantee that resources are efficiently applied.
The study9s purpose was to determine whether the Manchester Triage System (MTS) second version is a useful instrument for determining the risk of hospital admission, intrahospital death and resource utilisation in ED and to compare it with the MTS first version.
This was a prospective study of patients that attended the ED at a large hospital. It comprised a total of 25,218 cases that were triaged between 11 July and 13 October 2011. The MTS codes were grouped into two clusters: red and orange into a ‘high acuity/priority’ (HP) cluster, and yellow, green and blue into a ‘low acuity/priority’ cluster.
The risk of hospital admission in the HP cluster was 4.86 times that of the LP cluster for both admission route and ages.
